# To-do

- [ ] Ask Anna regarding gemoetry
- [ ] Do the Dark? Ask Anna. They say usually not used, but I see them included.  I just realized they do game some darks. If do it have to redo the flat. 

- [ ] There are two Illum but only on needed. Use one?
- [ ] How to do sciebasci. Merge all objects or what? For STD there is only one. 
- [ ]  musescibase merge = true o false?
- [ ] Ask Ana about STD datacube. Looks noise.
